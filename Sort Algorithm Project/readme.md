1. Insertion sort 
2. Heap sort 
3. Merge sort 
4. Quick sort.(version 1, version 2, version 3) 
The running time of each sorting algorithm must be measured in two ways: 
A. Count the number of key comparisons, COMPCOUNT.  
B. Use the actual measured CLOCK time. 
The experiment in two parts. 
For simplicity, you may use integers. For each case, make sure the same original data is input to all four algorithms 
1. A small array size, n = 32, to verify correctness Run each algorithm on two sets of data: (1) Sorted, (2) Randomly generated. 
2. Large array sizes (n=210=1024) for randomly generate data to determine time complexity
